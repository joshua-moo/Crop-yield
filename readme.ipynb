    "Features (X): All columns except the target variable (hg/ha_yield).\n",

    "The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.\n",
    "Model Setup and Training:\n",
    "\n",
    "MLP Regressor (Multi-Layer Perceptron) is initialized with:\n",
    "Hidden Layers: 100 neurons in the first layer and 50 in the second.\n",
    "Activation Function: relu (Rectified Linear Unit), which introduces non-linearity.\n",
    "Solver: adam, a common optimizer for neural networks.\n",
    "Maximum Iterations: 500 epochs, or training cycles.\n",
    "The model is trained on the training data (X_train, y_train).\n",
    "Predictions and Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is tested by predicting maize yield for the testing data (X_test).\n",
    "Performance metrics are calculated to assess accuracy:\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 9951.85, meaning the predictions deviate by about 9951.85 hectograms per hectare from actual values.\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE): 197,733,611.27, which highlights the presence of larger prediction errors.\n",
    "R-squared (R²): 0.7307, indicating that the model explains about 73.1% of the variance in maize yield based on the features.\n",
    "Summary of Results\n",
    "While the model achieves a fair R-squared value of 0.7307, suggesting it captures much of the variability in the data, the MAE and MSE are relatively high. This indicates that the model has some accuracy but still produces significant errors, suggesting potential for improvement. Tuning the neural network parameters, adjusting the data, or engineering additional features could enhance performance."
